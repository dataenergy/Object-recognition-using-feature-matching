# Object recognition using feature matching

The objective is to use feature matching to recognize a known object in any given image by applying various image processing techniques.

The task is accomplished using OpenCV and Python and it is presented in the Jupyter Notebook 'Object recognition using feature matching.ipynb'. The images used are stored in the 'images' folder. An output image generated by the code is also stored in the 'images' folder. It is named as 'query.png'. While downloading and running the project you can delete the 'query.png' file in the 'images' folder.
